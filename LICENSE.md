# ContainerSSH Assets and Marks

The ContainerSSH name and the ContainerSSH logos have been created by Janos Pasztor and Sanja Bonic. Graphic assets have been created by Bence Santha. To keep things fair we ask you use the name and logos in keeping with the following rules:

1. **Only use the ContainerSSH name, logos and graphic assets to represent ContainerSSH** distributed through the [containerssh.io](https://containerssh.io) website. Do not use the ContainerSSH logo and graphic assets to represent or illustrate separately maintained forks or other software or other software. (You may use them on forks intended for submitting pull requests to ContainerSSH.)
3. **Do not use** the ContainerSSH name and logos **as part of your own logo, trademark,** or unregistered marks.
4. If you wish to write a tool that interacts with ContainerSSH, **name it "X for ContainerSSH"**, but not "ContainerSSH X".
5. Do not make false representation of your affiliation with ContainerSSH. For example, if you sell swag (t-shirts, mugs, etc) you must make clear to the average user that your store is not an official swag store for ContainerSSH. (Adding it to the small print is not enough.)
6. Otherwise, feel free to make mashups, custom artworks, use them in your blog posts about ContainerSSH as you see fit.

Permission hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of these assets, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, or sublicense the ContainerSSH name, logos, and graphic assets subject to the above conditions.
