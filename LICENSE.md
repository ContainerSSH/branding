# ContainerSSH Assets and Marks

The ContainerSSH name and the ContainerSSH logos have been created by Janos Pasztor and Sanja Bonic. To keep things fair we ask you use the name and logos in keeping with the following rules:

1. Use the ContainerSSH name and logos only to represent ContainerSSH distributed through the website [containerssh.io](https://containerssh.io). Do not use the ContainerSSH logo to represent separately maintained forks or other software.
2. Do not use the ContainerSSH name and logos as part of your own logo, trademark, or unregistered marks.
3. If you wish to write a tool that interacts with ContainerSSH, name it "X for ContainerSSH", but not "ContainerSSH X".
4. Do not sell the original ContainerSSH logo, do not sell "swag" (shirts, hoodies, mugs etc.) with the ContainerSSH logo. You may sell or sublicense a substantially modified logo.

Permission hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of these assets, to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, or sublicense the ContainerSSH name and logos subject to the above conditions.
